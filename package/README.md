# Airport

This is an add-on for the Mozilla WebThings Gateway, designed to be installed on the Raspberry Pi. It allows the Raspberry Pi to act as a receiver for Apple Airport audio streaming. it also supports video streaming, but this obviously only works if there is a screen attached to your Raspberry Pi.
